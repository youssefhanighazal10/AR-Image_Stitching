# AR-Image_Stitching
## Part 1
Implementing an AR application step by step using planar homographies. Firstly, learning to find point correspondences between two images and use
these to estimate the homography between them. Using this homography to warp images and finally implementing the AR application.

## Part 2
Implementing an image stitcher that uses image warping and homographies to automatically create an image mosaic. We will focus on the case where
we have two input images that should form the mosaic, where we warp one image into the plane of the second image and display the combined views.

## Part 3
Same as part 2 but using three images.
